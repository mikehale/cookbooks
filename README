To setup passenger under ruby enterprise edition add the following cookbooks to your chef-repo:
 build-essential
 apache2
 ruby_enterprise_edition
 passenger
 rails_passenger

Then configure your node(s) to use the rails_passenger recipe, and run chef-client or chef-solo and wala chef prepares you a tasty dish of apache+passenger+REE!

Oh and these cookbooks have only been tested on ubuntu intrepid (8.10)

I need to refactor some of these cookebooks like passenger and syslog-ng to be more loosley coupled.

TODO

* app specific monit definitions
* configure sudo
* add developer ssh keys
* setup apps dir
* setup app user
* fix apache/rails syslog stuff
